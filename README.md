# Meta XR Hackaton Hieroguess

Hello ! 

This is a regular APK made with Unity, so all you have to do is put it on your Quest 2 using SideQuest or the Oculus Developer Hub and you'll find the app under "Unknown sources".

Here's the video that explains how the game is played : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yg8FwW5ypw. I'm French so I hope you understand me correctly :P

There's no advanced metaverse IA room-mapping feature so it'll not actually map your walls :). During the setup phase where you place your hand against your wall, it's better to do it where you have at least one 
meter available on each side of your hand. A 4x4m play space is ideal.

Also, the game rely on a grabbing mechanic to move things around, so make sure you have enough light in your room to improve the tracking accuracy.

Have fun !
